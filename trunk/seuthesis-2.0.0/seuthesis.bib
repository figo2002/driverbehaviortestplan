  address = {Cambridge,MA},
  abstract = {This thesis contributes to the development of microscopic traffic
	performance models which includes the acceleration and lane changing
	models. It enhances the existing models and develops new ones. Another
	major contribution of this thesis is the empirical work, i.e., estimating
	the models using statistically rigorous methods and microscopic data
	collected from real traffic. The acceleration model defines two regimes
	of traffic flow: the car-following regime and the free-flow regime.
	In the car-following regime, a driver is assumed to follow his/her
	leader, while in the free-flow regime, a driver is assumed to try
	to attain his/her desired speed. A probabilistic model, that is based
	on a time headway threshold, is used to determine the regime the
	driver belongs to. Heterogeneity across drivers is captured through
	the headway threshold and reaction time distributions. The parameters
	of the car-following and free-flow acceleration models along with
	the headway threshold and reaction time distributions are jointly
	estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. The lane
	changing decision process is modeled as a sequence of three steps:
	decision to consider a lane change, choice of a target lane, and
	gap acceptance. Since acceptable gaps are hard to find in a heavily
	congested traffic, a forced merging model that captures forced lane
	changing behavior and courtesy yielding is developed. A discrete
	choice model framework is used to model the impact of the surrounding
	traffic environment and lane configuration on drivers' lane changing
	decision process. The models are estimated using actual traffic data
	collected from Interstate 93 at the Central Artery, located in downtown
	Boston, MA, USA. In addition to assessing the model parameters from
	statistical and behavioral standpoints, the models are statistical
	and behavioral standpoints, the models are validated using a microscopic
	traffic simulator. Overall, the empirical results are encouraging,
	and demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework. (Copies

  abstract = {We investigate the conditions that produce a phase transition from
	an ordered to a disordered state in a family of models of two-dimensional

	the Self-Driven Particles Model introduced by Vicsek et al. Each
	model is distinguished only by the rules that determine the set of
	elements with which each element interacts. We propose a new member
	of the family: the vectorial network model, in which a given fraction
	of the elements interact through direct random connections. This
	model is analogous to an XY-system on a network, and as such can
	be of interest for a wide range of problems. It captures the main
	aspects of the interaction dynamics that produce the phase transition
	in other models of the family. The network approach allows us to
	show analytically the existence of a phase transition in this vectorial
	network model, and to compute its relevant parameters for the case
	in which all elements are randomly connected. Finally we study numerically
	the conditions required for a phase transition to exist for different
	members of the family. Our results show that a qualitatively equivalent
	phase transition appears whenever even a small amount of long-range
	interactions are present (or built over time), regardless of other
	equilibrium or non-equilibrium properties of the system.}

  title = {Speed characteristics of urban streets based on driver behaviour
	studies and simulation},
  year = {2006},
  type = {C829891},
  abstract = {The objective of the study was to gain in-depth knowledge of speed
	relationships for urban streets. The speed characteristics were examined
	using a number of methods for data collection. Throughout the research,
	a special focus was placed on capturing the influence on driver speed
	of interactions with pedestrians, cyclists and other road users,
	called side-friction events in this study. First, driver behaviour
	and travel time data was collected from field and driving simulator
	studies for a range of street types and traffic conditions. The collected
	data was used to calibrate a microscopic traffic simulation model.
	Production runs with this model were performed for various traffic
	conditions. Second, aggregated speed data was collected at the link
	level, i.e. the macro level, for three street types. In combination
	with street site variables, speed and flow data was analysed using
	multiple regression techniques with space mean speed as dependent
	variable. This analysis was also performed for average travel speed
	data produced by microscopic traffic simulation. Two central results
	were attained and utilized for the model development: (1) In-depth
	knowledge of which factors influence speed choice on urban street
	links with minor intersections, on a micro and macro level. (2) A
	comprehensive research methodology for study of speed characteristics
	on urban streets in which the knowledge gained at the micro and macro
	level was applied. Results from the micro study showed that Average
	number of crossing pedestrians and Traffic flow had significant impact
	on average travel speed (R 2 =0.91). Results from the macro study
	performed for three street types showed that Street function and
	Number of lanes also had a high degree of explanation (R 2 close
	to 0.70). The variables Separated bicycle lane, Roadside parking
	permitted and Number of minor intersections per 1 km were significant
	for some of the street types modelled in the macro study. The variables
	Ratio of through vehicles and Gender of the driver were also investigated
	and were found not to influence space-mean speed. The macro study
	demonstrated that speed choice and driver behaviour were consistent
	for each street type investigated regardless of city type and population
	size. The speed-flow relationships of the micro model for an urban
	street type showed good agreement with the macro model for traffic
	flows in the upper range. In conclusion, the research effort showed
	that the included side-friction variables added explanatory value
	to the estimation of speed, and thus can enhance the knowledge of
	traffic impacts of different urban street designs.},

	at rural expressway intersections with respect to age (younger, middle-aged,

	occur where a median-divided highway meets a two-lane, stop-controlled
	minor road. One intersection was identified as a high-crash area

	curves. All participants were asked to perform three driving maneuvers
	(i.e., going straight across, making a left and a right turn) from
	the two-lane minor roads. Age and intersection differences immediately
	before entering and within these intersections were examined. Sixty
	drivers participated in the study and were divided evenly between
	the younger (18 to 25), middle-aged (35 to 55), and older (65 to
	80) groups. Data for each participant were collected from an on-road
	study in an instrumented vehicle. Results showed that both older
	and younger drivers were likely to run stop signs and less likely
	to yield at medians when compared with middle-aged drivers. The effect
	of age difference on driving performance before intersection entry
	was consistent with previous studies. Middle-aged drivers approached
	the high-crash intersection with significantly less brake pedal differential
	time and were less likely to run stop signs compared with actions
	by drivers in other age groups. Higher traffic volume and more complicated
	road geometry at the high-crash intersection may be factors contributing
	to the differences observed.},

	Driving Simulator (LADS) could be modified to overcome any deficiencies

	lateral displacement in terms of mean and standard deviation were
	chosen to represent driver behaviour. They were measured under free-flowing

	by comparing observational uncontrolled real road data with experimental

	differing styles was recorded and analysed with the aid of a timebase
	video facility. It was found that approximately 7% of all drivers
	were involved in some form of near-miss for which evasive action
	was necessary. In addition to basic descriptive information, inferential
	statistical techniques were used to identify factors contributing
	to near-miss incidents in addition to signalling, tracking and approach
	speed behaviours. The information derived from this first study was
	used, in conjunction with that obtained from group discussions, to
	develop a questionnaire. Using a postal distribution technique, the
	questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of British full
	driving license obtained from the records of the Driver and Vehicle
	Licensing Authority. An additional sample was obtained from the Thames
	Valley Police accident records at Milton Keynes to ensure that a

	Respondents were asked to provide details of the most recent accident,

	respondents to the questionnaire reported such accidents, and the
	information provided was used to establish factors implicated in
	accident-involvement, and particularly accident culpability, at junctions.
	In addition to sex and exposure factors, it was found that self-descriptive
	metavariables were the most effective at predicting aspects of involvement
	in accidents at junctions. In particular, those deemed to be accident-liable
	were more likely to describe themselves as self-centred and ill-mannered.
	Other metavariables, particularly those recording the subjective
	riskiness of various manoeuvres, were also found to be useful discriminators
	between various sub-groups of accident-involved drivers. It was discovered
	that those drivers initially trained by a qualified instructor were
	more likely to respond in similar ways to accident-involved drivers.
	In contrast, those who had taken some form of advanced tuition were

	In addition, the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined
	by the systematic gas-kinetic model derived from the Boltzmann equation.
	Multiplying Boltzmann equation by the zeroth, first- and second-order
	moment functions, integrating both side of the equation and using
	chain rules, we can derive continuity, motion and variance equation,
	respectively. However, the second-order moment function, which is
	the square of the individual velocity, is employed by previous researches
	does not have physical meaning in traffic flow. Although the second-order
	expansion results in the velocity variance equation, additional terms
	may be generated. The velocity variance equation we propose is derived
	from multiplying Boltzmann equation by the individual velocity variance.
	It modifies the previous model and presents a new gas-kinetic traffic

	simplest version of the theory, which is described in its full complexity
	without calculus, is shown to be qualitatively consistent with experimental
	observations, including the most puzzling. Its predictions agree
	with the following phenomena: (i) the [`]reversed lambda' pattern

	the lane-specific evolution of the data points with time, including
	the [`]hysteresis' phenomenon, (ii) the lane-specific patterns in

  abstract = {This paper examines the behavior of multi-lane freeway traffic past
	on-ramps, building on the continuum model of part I and focusing
	on the onset of congestion. The main complication is that rabbits
	(fast vehicles) entering from an on-ramp usually stay on the shoulder
	lane(s) of the freeway for some distance before merging into the
	fast lane(s). An idealization is proposed, where this distance is
	taken to be the same for all vehicles. As a result, the system behaves
	as if there was a fixed buffer zone downstream of the on-ramp where
	entering rabbits cannot change lanes. The model of part I is extended
	to capture the peculiarities of traffic within such a buffer zone,
	including its two end-points: the "entrance" and the "merge". The
	onset of congestion is described by means of waves. The paper shows
	that this highly idealized model (and its more realistic cousins)
	explains qualitatively all the puzzling facts discussed in part I
	without introducing obviously unreasonable phenomena. A typical sequence
	of events during the onset of congestion is predicted to be as follows:
	(i) increased on-ramp flows and the ensuing merging maneuvers into
	the median (passing) lane generate a (fast-moving) queue at the merge
	that grows on the median lane(s) of the buffer; (ii) when the speed
	in this queue drops below the level on the shoulder lanes, a 1-pipe
	queue forms at the merge, which then grows upstream across all lanes;
	(iii) if the front of this queue moves slowly forward, as per the
	model of part I, then the lane-flows at the merge would be at "capacity"
	from then on (with roughly the same speed across all lanes) but downstream
	of the front there would be a "discharge state" with less total flow.
	Therefore, an observer downstream of the merge would see this discharge
	state before the capacity state, and would record a drop in flow
	followed by a recovery. If the front of the queue would move slowly
	backward, then the sequence of events following (ii) is somewhat
	different.}

	problems with and without discontinuous data, is shown not to hold

	approximation, the flow between two neighboring lattice points is
	the minimum of the two values returned by: 1. (a) a "sending" function
	evaluated at the density prevailing at the upstream lattice point
	and2. (b) a "receiving" function evaluated at the downstream lattice

	and decreasing branches of the freeway's flow-density curve. The
	article presents an asymptotic formula for the errors introduced
	by the proposed finite difference approximation and describes quantitatively
	the finite difference's shock-capturing behavior. Errors are shown
	to be approximately proportional to the mesh spacing with a coefficient
	of proportionality that depends on the wave speed, on its rate of
	change with density, and on the slope and curvature of the initial
	density profile. The asymptotic errors are smaller than those of
	Lax's first-order, centered difference method which is also convergent.
	More importantly though, the proposed procedure never yields negative
	flows, and this makes it attractive in practical engineering applications
	when the mesh cannot be made arbitrarily small.}

  abstract = {This thesis documents new research into the modelling of driver vision
	and the integration of a new vision model into a microscopic traffic
	simulation tool.  It is proposed and demonstrated that modelling
	of driver vision enhances the realism of simulated driver decision-making
	and behaviour, in turn, leading to improved simulation of driver
	interactions and traffic flow. Driving and traffic research has traditionally
	fallen into the three distinct areas of driver psychology, traffic
	and highway engineering and vehicle dynamics, with modelling or experimentation
	in any of these areas supported by significant approximation in the
	others.  In contrast to this, the vision research discussed here
	has been carried out in a context that aims to integrate all of these
	areas equally.  This has been realised through the implementation
	of a new modelling environment, Synthetic Driving SIMulation, SD-SIM. 
	Within SD-SIM, the driver vision model augments a previously developed
	model for driver decision-making through the visual detection of
	other vehicles and perception of their behaviour.  This removes the
	gross approximation, found in other contemporary microscopic driving
	simulation frameworks, of 'perfect vision' where drivers simply share
	data concerning vehicle positions and speeds. The novelty of the
	approach in SD-SIM is that it provides an opportunity to model intelligent
	virtual drivers that are capable of perceiving their own environment,
	making decisions based on what they 'see' and taking appropriate
	actions.  This allows proactive and reactive interactions between
	driver agents, reducing the need to be prescriptive in modelling
	driving scenarios.  Furthermore, SD-SIM contributes to the understanding
	of traffic interactions through the examination of alternative traffic
	scenarios or "what if" analyses to obtain quantitative estimates
	of driver behaviour and its consequences.  SD-SIM has been validated
	through comparison with real-life driving experiments in addition
	to the development of a case study based on real-life accident data. 
	The experimental evaluation measures the performance of virtual driver
	behaviour and the case study provides functional evaluation to assess
	scenario modelling and quantitative estimates of driver behaviour.},

  type = {NQ42821},
  abstract = {In an Intelligent Transport System, for a vehicle which follows a
	path without the presence of a human driver, the control law development
	requires the modeling of the human driver behavior. A driver behavior
	are classified in three different levels: Control, Supervision, and
	Definition. (1) Control level is the lowest level with the responsibility
	of reaching the desired speed and maintaining the vehicle on the
	path. This level models driver compensatory reactions. (2) Some of
	the driver intelligent activities which play a role in the modeling
	of the driver behavior are realized at the Supervision level. This
	level is placed above the control level and it defines and modifies
	the control level desired values. (3) The itinerary, road geometric
	limits and speed limits are defined at the Definition level. In this
	thesis the focus is on the control law developments for the control
	level, which requires an analysis on the kinematics and dynamics
	of ground vehicles. The research has been carried out in three steps
	which resulted in three publications given in appendices A, B and
	C. The first step consists in developing a control law based on a
	dynamic model of car-like mobile robots. The controllability of omnidirectional
	mobile robots has been vastly studied before. Taking advantage of
	these studies, the kinematic differences between these two mobile
	robot families have been pointed out. Input/Output Feedback linearization
	(I/OFL) method has been used to develop the first control law commanding
	a car-like robot speed and its instantaneous curvature. In the second
	step, the objective is to complete the vehicle lateral control. But,
	the I/OFL cannot be realized for the Cartesian coordinates of any
	point attached to the vehicle main body, however it is possible for
	a point attached to the front steerable tire. Similar to the first
	step, the nonlinear dynamic model has been used for the controller
	design. Conventionally, the control of robots is based on inputs
	of desired trajectories, which are functions of time. The approach
	is not a convenient choice for the structure of our control level.
	Hence, in the third step, the lateral control law has been developed
	using a geometric lateral-offset as the system input instead of the
	conventional desired trajectories. This input removes the time dependence
	of lateral inputs and the vehicle speed control becomes independent
	from the vehicle lateral control. As a result, the supervision level
	can modify the control level inputs (desired values) which is an
	essential element for the integration of the driver intelligent activities
	at the supervision level.},

  abstract = {Assumed driver braking performance in emergency situations is not

	in an emergency situation "it is suspected that drivers apply their
	brakes as hard as possible." This idea differs from a 1984 report
	that states drivers will "modulate" their braking to maintain directional
	control. Thus, additional information is needed about driver braking
	performance when an unexpected object is in the roadway. In this
	research driver braking distances and decelerations to both unexpected
	and anticipated stops were measured. The study design allowed for
	differences in vehicle handling and driver capabilities associated
	with antilock braking systems (ABS), wet and dry pavement conditions,
	and the effects of roadway geometry. Vehicle speeds, braking distances,
	and deceleration profiles were determined for each braking maneuver.
	The research results show that ABS result in shorter braking distances
	by as much as 30 m at 90 km/h. These differences were most noticeable
	on wet pavements where ABS resulted in better control and shorter
	braking distances. Braking distances on horizontal curves were slightly
	longer than on tangent sections; however, they were not large enough
	to be of practical significance. Maximum deceleration during braking
	is independent of initial velocity, at least in the range of speeds
	tested. Differences were noted in individual driver performance in
	terms of maximum deceleration. Although maximum deceleration was
	equal to the pavement's coefficient of friction for some drivers,
	the average maximum deceleration was about 75% of that level. Overall,
	drivers generated maximum decelerations from 6.9 to 9.1 m/sq s. The

	[Wilde, G.J.S., 1982. The theory of risk homeostasis: implications

	to subjective estimates of the probability of collision. This theoretical
	paper argues that what drivers attempt to maintain is a level of
	task difficulty. Näätänen and Summala [Näätänen, R., Summala, H.,
	1976. Road User Behaviour and Traffic Accidents. North Holland/Elsevier,
	Amsterdam, New York] similarly rejected the concept of statistical
	risk as a determinant of driver behaviour, but in so doing fell back
	on the learning process to generate a largely automatised selection
	of appropriate safety margins. However it is argued here that driver
	behaviour cannot be acquired and executed principally in such S-R
	terms. The concept of task difficulty is elaborated within the framework
	of the task-capability interface (TCI) model, which describes the
	dynamic interaction between the determinants of task demand and driver
	capability. It is this interaction which produces different levels
	of task difficulty. Implications of the model are discussed regarding
	variation in performance, resource allocation, hierarchical decision-making
	and the interdependence of demand and capability. Task difficulty
	homeostasis is proposed as a key sub-goal in driving and speed choice
	is argued to be the primary solution to the problem of keeping task
	difficulty within selected boundaries. The relationship between task
	difficulty and mental workload and calibration is clarified. Evidence
	is cited in support of the TCI model, which clearly distinguishes
	task difficulty from estimates of statistical risk. However, contrary
	to expectation, ratings of perceived risk depart from ratings of
	statistical risk but track difficulty ratings almost perfectly. It
	now appears that feelings of risk may inform driver decision making,
	as Taylor originally suggested, but not in terms of risk of collision,
	but rather in terms of task difficulty. Finally risk homeostasis
	is presented as a special case of task difficulty homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Acceleration models are at the core of operational driving behaviors,
	and include car-following models which capture interactions between
	a lead and following vehicles. The main assumption in these models
	is that the behavior of the following vehicle is directly related
	to a stimulus observed/perceived by the driver, defined relative
	to the lead vehicle. In addition to the operational aspect, lane
	changing models capture the tactical side of driving. Most lane changing
	models have followed a deterministic rule-based framework where changing
	lanes is directly related to the desirability of such maneuver, its
	necessity and its possibility/safety. An important aspect heretofore
	missing from previous formulations pertains to the stochastic and
	possibly unsafe character of the cognitive processes followed by
	drivers, such as perception, judgment and execution while driving.
	Recognizing the limitations of existing microscopic traffic models,
	the objective of this research is to advance the state of knowledge
	in modeling driver behavior processes and the state of the art of
	microscopic traffic simulation by incorporating cognitive dimensions
	of the driver task, including risk-perception and risk-taking behaviors.
	This representation is intended to capture driver behavior in complex
	environments such as those associated with congested conditions,
	accident-prone situations and extreme regimes. Addressing the above
	objective is accomplished by introducing a tactical lane-changing
	and an operational car-following model that reflects the psychological
	and cognitive aspects of 4 the driving process and captures risk
	taking behavior under uncertainty. In the car-following model, Prospect
	Theory provides a theoretical and operational basis to represent
	how drivers weigh different alternatives. In the lane-changing model,
	a hazard-based framework is introduced; driving is a continuous story
	divided into different experienced episodes. Each episode is terminated
	probabilistically based on the surrounding traffic conditions as
	well as the drivers' characteristics. After implementing and testing
	the resulting microscopic model, it was found that anticipation,
	anisotropy and the duration of a driving experience have significant
	influence on drivers' behaviour. Promising results have been found
	especially in terms of stochastic equilibrium and congestion formation.
	Accidents can be generated as an inherent output of the model dynamics
	and no artificial constraints are needed to prevent them.},

  abstract = {About twenty percent of the U.S. National Highway System is under

	crashes and more than 1,000 fatalities per year. The major question
	on which this research focuses is: "How do work zone delineation
	strategies, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies,
	and driver behavior impact traffic flow and crash potential in and
	around work zones?" To address this question effectively, one might
	consider assessing actual traffic situations under local conditions

	could be useful to individuals designing work zone deployment plans,
	developing work zone traffic management concepts, deciding on the

	the derivation of the macroscopic flow model is the user-class specific
	phase-space density, which can be considered as a generalization
	of the traditional density. The gas-kinetic equations describing
	the dynamics of the multiclass Phase-Space Density (MUC-PSD) are
	governed by various, interacting processes, such as acceleration
	towards a class-specific desired velocity, deceleration caused by
	vehicle interactions and the influence of lane changing. The gas-kinetic
	equations serve as the foundation of the proposed macroscopic traffic
	flow models, describing the dynamics of the class-dependent spatial
	density, velocity and velocity variance. The modeling approach yields
	explicit relations for both the velocity and the velocity variance.
	These equilibrium relations show competing processes: on the one
	hand, drivers accelerate towards their class-dependent desired velocity,
	while on the other hand, they need to decelerate due to interactions
	with vehicles from their own class and asymmetric interactions with
	vehicles from other classes. Using the operationalized model, macroscopic
	simulations provide insight into the model behavior for different

  abstract = {Some agencies use durable fluorescent orange sign sheeting on warning
	signs in work zones. The literature shows that such sheeting is more
	conspicuous than standard nonfluorescent orange sheeting, but no
	one has yet demonstrated that the greater conspicuity leads to operational
	changes or fewer collisions. To investigate that link, operational
	studies were conducted in seven long-term North Carolina work zones
	with left-lane drops on multilane highways. The before-and-after
	with control experiment design was likely immune from common experimental
	flaws. Five operational measures were collected manually at the beginning
	of the approach to the work zone, the taper, and midway between the
	beginning and the taper. Fluorescent orange signs were found to cause
	some changes, primarily positive, in driver behavior. With fluorescent
	signs, there were somewhat fewer traffic conflicts, the percentage
	of vehicles in the left lane at the midpoint was lower, and trucks
	moved out of the left lane sooner. Mean speeds increased slightly,
	but usually not significantly, with fluorescent signs, but speed
	variances tended to decrease with fluorescent signs. The operational
	changes observed should mean that work zones similar to those in
	the experiment would experience a small reduction in collisions with
	fluorescent orange warning signs. Use of fluorescent orange sheeting
	on warning signs is recommended in work zones like those in this
	experiment and in other types of work zones where warning drivers
	is as critical or more critical than it was in this experiment.},

	MOBIL) is proposed to derive lane-changing rules for discretionary
	and mandatory lane changes for a wide class of car-following models.
	Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane
	changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated
	with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the
	formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria
	for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative
	elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these
	car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing
	rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes
	and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages
	and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change
	via the "politeness factor." The parameter allows one to vary the
	motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative
	driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent
	lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers
	and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of
	a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon
	is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for
	passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and
	trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following
	model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting

  abstract = {Freeway entrance ramp accelerations and merging processes are complex
	and have significant impacts upon freeway traffic operations and
	ramp junction geometric designs. The complexity is a result of the
	fact that driver psychological components have multiple dimensions
	affecting freeway merge decisions. The major objective of this dissertation
	is to develop empirical methodologies for modeling ramp driver acceleration-deceleration
	and gap acceptance behavior during freeway merge maneuvers. A large
	quantity of freeway merge data were collected from several entrance
	ramps including both parallel and taper type acceleration lanes capturing
	a wide traffic flow range to suit different analysis purposes. Comprehensive
	freeway merge traffic analyses were conducted using the collected
	data. Both graphical presentations and independence tests in contingency
	tables indicated that ramp vehicle merge behavior is insignificantly
	related to any single traffic parameter, such as ramp vehicle approach
	speeds, freeway flow levels, and speed differentials as well as time
	or distance gaps between ramp vehicles and surrounding freeway and
	ramp vehicles. Combination forms of these traffic parameters were
	found to be better indicators for modeling freeway merge driver behavior.
	Initially, ramp vehicle acceleration-deceleration behavior models
	were conceptually formulated as extended forms of conventional nonlinear
	car-following models incorporating joint freeway and ramp vehicle
	effects. These sophisticated nonlinear specifications, although theoretically
	attractive, have been proven to be infeasible to predict dynamic
	ramp vehicle acceleration-deceleration rates. A bi-level calibration
	framework, however, successfully provided good calibration results.
	A multinomial probit model, using speed differentials, distance separations
	of ramp vehicles to corresponding freeway and ramp vehicles, distance
	to the acceleration lane terminus, and Markov indexes as attributes,
	predicted ramp driver acceleration, deceleration, or constant speed
	choice behavior. The resulting acceleration or deceleration rate
	magnitudes were predicted by a family of exponential curves using
	ramp vehicle speed as an explanatory variable. Calibration results
	of a binary logit gap acceptance function indicated that perceived
	ramp driver angular velocity to a corresponding freeway lag vehicle
	and remaining distance to the acceleration lane end are the best

	can be applied for the design of human-centered control algorithms
	in adaptive cruise control (ACC) and other longitudinal active-safety

	modeling of traffic systems and Intelligent Transportation Systems
	(ITS), which could be traced back to the work of GeneralMotor (GM)
	Co. in 1950's. In the early time, researchers were only interested

	and producing reasonable flow dynamics on a macroscopic level. With
	the booming interest on driver modeling on a microscopic level and
	needs in ITS developments, researchers now emphasize modeling using
	microscopic data acquired from real world. To follow this research
	trend, a methodological framework on car-following data acquisition,
	analysis and modeling has been developed step by step in this thesis,

	and emotions influence driver behaviour. The first study focused
	on the commission of violations, mistakes, slips and risky manoeuvres.
	It was found that negative affects, such as irritability and anger,
	which can find behavioural expression in hostile or aggressive acts,
	led to a deterioration in driving performance. The effect was less
	pronounced for affects such as anxiety and fear, which are thought
	to contain an element of caution. Positive affects, such as cheerfulness
	and elation did not always shift behaviour in a positive direction
	(relative to the respondent's usual style of driving). This may be
	because some unlawful or risky driving behaviours, such as speeding,
	may also be used in the behavioural expression of positive moods
	and emotions. The second study investigated people's beliefs about
	how well they cope in the driving situation when experiencing moods
	and emotions. In general drivers reported that they cope better when
	they experience a positive affect than when they experience a negative
	affect. Young drivers, male drivers and young male drivers in particular,
	gave higher self-ratings than other respondent groups. These were
	the same groups which had emerged from the first study as being most
	likely to perform risky manoeuvres and commit violations. It seems
	likely that confidence in one's own ability to cope helps to determine
	the extent to which moods and emotions are given behavioural expression.
	It is suggested that although moods and emotions may ideally serve
	a useful function in helping people to adapt to environmental changes
	the link between affect and behaviour is complex, involving learning
	through experience and the acquisition of cultural norms and values.
	Such mediating influences may leave these three groups of drivers

  abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulation programs are useful tools to provide
	cost-effective, objective, and flexible approach for the evaluation
	of emerging advanced technologies, such as Intelligent Transportation
	Systems. These programs provide a dynamic representation of individual
	vehicles on road networks. These programs are usually composed of
	several models including a representation of roadway geometry, vehicle
	routing, origin-destination information, lane changing, and car-following
	models. This thesis contributes to the development of two models
	of a microscopic traffic simulation program. These two models are
	the car-following model and the discretionary lane change model.
	Car-following models describe the process by which drivers follow
	each other in the traffic stream. Discretionary lane change models
	on the other hand describe the driver behaviour when drivers make
	a lane change to improve perceived driving conditions. This thesis
	describes characteristics of a number of existing car-following and
	discretionary lane change models, and identifies their assumptions
	that tend to restrict their ability in explaining and estimating
	driver behaviour in actual traffic situations. A new car-following
	and a new discretionary lane change model are proposed that address
	many of limitations of the existing models. The car-following model
	developed in this thesis assumes that drivers adjust their speed
	based on the current spacing and rate of change in current spacing
	to the next downstream vehicle. The proposed car-following model,
	unlike many existing car-following models, does not make unrealistic
	assumptions about drivers' ability to ascertain exactly the absolute
	speed and/or acceleration/deceleration rate of the downstream vehicles.
	In determining the acceleration/deceleration rate of the following
	vehicle, the proposed model considers a more extensive view of downstream
	traffic (i.e., two downstream lead vehicles). The proposed car-following
	model also takes into account the changes in response time of the
	following vehicle driver due to the brake light status and position
	of the lead vehicles. The discretionary lane change model developed
	in this thesis consists of two components; the desire model and the
	gap-acceptance model. The desire model assumes that a driver's decision
	for making a discretionary lane change depends on speed benefit accumulated
	over time rather than instantaneous speed benefit over a small simulation
	interval, dt. The gap-acceptance model is a binary logit model that
	calculates the probability of initiating a lane change manoeuvre
	based on gap-acceptance conditions in the adjacent lane. The proposed
	car-following and discretionary lane change models are calibrated
	and validated using field data obtained from an arterial roadway.
	The validation results of the proposed models are encouraging and
	demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling framework.},

  title = {Simulation of traffic crashes using cell based micro-simulation},
  year = {2006},
  type = {3252152},
  abstract = {The deterioration of the safety of operation, coupled with the persistent
	increase in rearend crashes, is of great concern in finding accurate
	and realistic methods of modeling traffic flow and preventing traffic
	crashes. For some decades safety evaluation methods have relied on
	analysis of historical crash data. Since crashes are random and rare
	events and, in most cases, are independent events, it is difficult
	to find a sufficient number of crashes on a road section in a relatively
	short time period (e.g., a month or even a year). Thus, multi-year
	collection of crash data is used in safety analysis. Another safety
	evaluation method that has been practiced though in small scale is
	traffic conflict techniques (TCT). The advantage of using TCT in
	safety evaluations is the ability to test or study a safety strategy
	or improvement applied on the roadway facility in a relatively short
	period of time compared with traditional methods, which are dependent
	on crash data. However, use of TCT is not popular; perhaps because
	it needs extensive resources to collect, extract, and analyze conflict
	information. Moreover, like crash data analysis, use of TCT also
	makes concerned authorities reactive to the problem by responding
	to the crashes that have already occurred. Therefore, alternative
	proactive safety evaluation techniques that can improve the quality
	of traffic safety evaluation are needed at this time. One way of
	using proactive safety evaluation techniques and thus become more
	preventive than reactive towards dealing with the overall safety
	problem is to utilize the capability of traffic micro-simulation
	to assess safety on highways through examination of hazardous vehicle
	movements in the traffic stream. Using micro-simulation predictive
	methods, it may be possible to diagnose safety problems and apply
	appropriate remedial measures, rather than waiting until a crash
	occurs to remedy the problem. This means, a hazard can be early identified
	and possibly corrected before implementation of highway projects.
	In addition, the use of simulation tools to evaluate the safety of
	a traffic system can be advantageous because such tools provide extensive
	results for any study area within a relatively short time along with
	other traffic operational measures like level of service, delays,
	travel times, and capacities. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation
	was to analyze numerically the likelihood of the traffic crashes
	that might occur on the highway using cellular based micro-simulations.
	The modeling considered occurrence of rear-end crashes on high-speed
	highways with two lanes of traffic in each direction. Narrowing the
	safety evaluation to rear-end crashes, this study sought to analyze
	these crashes by providing simulation evidence of association between
	time-based traffic safety indicators and driver attributes with the
	likelihood of conflict or collision. To meet the study objectives,
	a stochastic cellular automata traffic model have been extended to
	use field-derived vehicle and driver characteristics. The vehicles'
	acceleration submodel in the simulation is categorized into different
	regimes depending on the prevailing traffic conditions. The vehicles
	evolutions in the proposed micro-simulation model are based on kinematic
	equations to enhance the realism of their advancements. Behavioral
	variance in the model is introduced by taking in consideration both
	driver aggression and responsiveness to the traffic conditions. The
	model is calibrated using field data. Comparison of simulated spacings
	and speeds obtained from the simulation output with vehicle trajectories
	data obtained from the field return a Mean Absolute Percentage Error
	(MAPE) of less than 10% and a Theil's coefficient of inequality (U)
	of about 0.002. These statistics inferred that the proposed model
	worked well in replicating traffic on the field. In addition, correlation
	results showed that simulation results not only agree to the theoretical
	results but also to the detector data collected from the field. The
	driver behavior was found to contri ute more in the likelihood of
	crashes which was determined by amount of great deceleration that
	driver apply to maintain safety during movement. The likelihood of
	vehicles to crash in the model was formulated from the Gamma distribution
	functions. Closer examination of the probability of a vehicle to
	crash in the model indicated that the likelihood of crashing is high
	when the traffic is flowing close to the maximum flow.},

  abstract = {Certain aspects of traffic flow measurements imply the existence of
	a phase transition. Models known from chaos and fractals, such as
	nonlinear analysis of coupled differential equations, cellular automata,

	transition in the flow behavior. Other measurements point out that
	the same behavior could be generated by geometrical constraints of
	the scenario. This paper looks at some of the empirical evidence,
	but mostly focuses on different modeling approaches. The theory of
	traffic jam dynamics is reviewed in some detail, starting from the
	well-established theory of kinematic waves and then veering into
	the area of phase transitions. One aspect of the theory of phase
	transitions is that, by changing one single parameter, a system can
	be moved from displaying a phase transition to not displaying a phase
	transition. This implies that models for traffic can be tuned so
	that they display a phase transition or not. This paper focuses on
	microscopic modeling, i.e., coupled differential equations, cellular
	automata, and coupled maps. The phase transition behavior of these
	models, as far as it is known, is discussed. Similarly, fluid-dynamical
	models for the same questions are considered. A large portion of
	this paper is given to the discussion of extensions and open questions,
	which makes clear that the question of traffic jam dynamics is, albeit
	important, only a small part of an interesting and vibrant field.
	As our outlook shows, the whole field is moving away from a rather
	static view of traffic toward a dynamic view, which uses simulation
	as an important tool.}

  abstract = {The primary aim of this thesis is to highlight the most important
	features of driving and to describe the models that have attempted
	to conceptualise these features. The discussion focuses on the concept
	of "safety margin." The concept is elaborated upon in an effort to
	enhance its usefulness as an empirical tool in traffic research.
	In this study, safety margin is defined as a threshold value that
	informs the driver when to undertake an action to minimise the risk
	of a car accident. Three separate studies of various driver behaviours
	are presented as illustrations of how this view can be applied in
	a real highway traffic setting. One study (Study I), consisting of
	three independent but related experiments, examines car following;
	a second study (Study II) explores gap acceptance at a T-crossing;
	and a third study (Study III) investigates drivers' braking decisions.
	The overall findings of the present studies suggest that it is valid
	to model driver behaviour as a concern related to the control of
	safety margins. It was shown that the driver controls time-distance
	dynamics to leading and following cars when driving in a queue. A
	bias in the drivers' impressions of distances to leading and following
	vehicles that has safety promoting implications was also found. There
	was no evidence for the hypothesised use of the limit for dissolution
	of time-distance to oncoming vehicles for merging decisions at a

  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can continuously monitor
	the time and location of vehicle usage. By recording and analyzing
	detailed vehicle activity data, researchers can analyze the safety
	and environmental implications of driver behavior and trip-making
	patterns. In 2000, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
	(NHTSA) awarded the Georgia Institute of Technology a contract to
	equip 1,100 vehicles with a GPS-enhanced device to collect speed
	and location data. The objective was to acquire more accurate information
	on the role of excessive speed on crash frequency and severity. GPS
	technology allows the researcher to continuously measure driver speed,
	acceleration, and location. When merged with roadway characteristics
	within a geographic information system (GIS) environment, determinations
	of driver risk-taking behavior can be made. Second, continuous logging
	of GPS data allows researchers to capture high-resolution vehicle
	activity immediately before a crash event, reducing the potential
	error and bias introduced during determination of precrash speed
	estimates. Until May 1, 2000, the military degraded the position
	accuracy of GPS signals for commercial use, known as selective availability.
	For researchers, life without selective availability is a great improvement.
	Travel routes can clearly be discerned without the addition of differential
	correction units. The accuracy of speed, acceleration, and position
	data obtained from GPS signals for use in determining driver performance
	parameters without selective availability was tested. The test included
	four GPS packages, both corrected and uncorrected, simultaneously
	validated against a distance-measuring instrument. Equipment configuration,
	data collection methods, and sources of error are reported. The results
	suggested that noncorrected data can be used to obtain data within
	a reasonable range of the application requirements. Even without
	selective availability, GPS accuracy is still problematic in urban
	canyons and under heavy tree canopies. Although filtering for urban
	canyon outliers is labor intensive in a continuous monitoring situation,
	improvements in GIS hold promise for automation of this task.},

  year = {2005},
  type = {3170092},
  abstract = {Previous research regarding the relationship between speeding behavior
	and crashes suggests that drivers who engage in frequent and extreme
	speeding behavior are over-involved in crashes.However, many of these
	earlier studies relied on estimates of prevailing and pre-crash speeds,
	and as a result, their conclusions have been questioned. Over the
	last several years automotive manufacturers have begun installing
	airbag systems that collect and maintain accurate pre-crash speeds.
	Though, patterns of driver speeding behavior are also necessary to
	discern whether drivers who regularly participate in speeding have
	increased risk of crash involvement. This dissertation presents a
	framework and methods for quantifying and analyzing individual driver
	behavior using instrumented vehicles. The goals of the research were
	threefold: (1) Develop processing methods and observational coding
	systems for quantifying driver speeding using instrumented vehicle
	data; (2) Develop a framework for analyzing aggregate and individual
	driver speeding behavior; and (3) Explore the potential application
	of behavioral safety concepts to transportation safety problems.
	Quantitative assessments of driver speeding behavior could be used
	in combination with event data recorder data to analyze crash risk.
	Additionally, speed behavior models could aid in the early identification
	of problem behavior as well as in the development of targeted countermeasure
	programs. For this research, 172 instrumented vehicles from the Commute
	Atlanta program were utilized to collect individual driver speeding
	behavior. Continuous monitoring capabilities allowed the capture
	of speed and location for every second of vehicle operation. Driver
	speeds were then matched to road networks and subsequently to posted
	speed limits using a geographic information system. This allowed
	calculation of differences between drivers speed and posted speed.
	Several processes were developed to assess the accuracy and the completeness
	of the data prior to analysis. Finally, metrics and analysis frameworks
	were tested for their potential usefulness in future behavioral risk
	analysis. The results of the research were both positive and staggering.
	On average, nearly 40% of all driving activity by the sample population
	was above the posted speed limit. The amount and extent of speeding
	was highest for young drivers. Trends indicate that speeding behavior
	decreases in amount and extent as age increases.},

	This includes construction of a PC-based driving simulator and the

	using a single degree-of-freedom unicycle model and on a two degree-of-freedom

	steering behaviour. Problems associated with the cross-spectral method
	and the indirect method in identifying closed-loop driver steering
	behaviour was investigated.  Both methods are shown to be susceptible
	to systematic bias errors, because output noise is correlated through

	a nonparametric identification scheme for closed-loop systems, and
	in particular the driver-vehicle system.  It is believe that all

	Nonparametric identification of the changed driver behaviour from
	driving data collected using the driving simulator is successfully

  abstract = {Many studies have shown that young drivers (under 26 years) are over-represented
	in the accident statistics. Until recently, there has been limited
	research in the U.K. relating characteristics of young drivers with
	accident risk, other than analysis of statistics and studies of drunk-driving.
	Many of these traditional approaches, which adopt the view of driving
	as a predominantly skill-based activity, are shown to be of limited
	use in explaining the driving behaviour of young drivers (predominantly
	males) once a driver has acquired the skills necessary to drive.
	After this stage, other influences have an increasing effect on driving
	behaviour. There is scope for a new multi-method approach concentrating
	on the social aspects of car driving behaviour. This thesis contributes
	to the understanding of car driving behaviour by examining a number
	of fundamental social issues which underlie car driver behaviour
	and which can be explained with reference to several psychological
	theories or hypotheses. Issues which are addressed include: driver
	ability and risk assessment, lifestyle, perceptions of cars and driving,
	peer and passenger effects, drinking behaviour and the car culture
	of young male drivers. Particular emphasis is placed on how and to
	what extent these affect younger male car driving behaviour. Two
	studies are reported. The first, which involved 439 drivers, identified
	a number of aspects of driver behavior and performance which help
	account for the different accident involvement rates across age whilst
	taking into account driving experience and exposure. The first study
	identified inter-group differences, the second explored, in more
	detail, intra-group differences evident within the younger male group
	(17-25 year olds). this involved interviewing 56 drivers, previously
	categorised as 'safe' or 'unsafe', and giving them the opportunity
	to provide their own accounts and explanations for their driving
	behaviour based on their own realities and experiences. Results demonstrate
	the merit of such a qualitative approach and show that young drivers
	should not be treated or labelled as one homogeneous group. An argument
	is presented for further investigation into 'young problem drivers'
	rather than the 'young driver problem' on which research has largely
	concentrated to date. In-depth understanding of the driving phenomenon

	there are three components to this transportation system; the road,
	the vehicle, and the driver. The interaction between the characteristics
	of these three components controls the level of safety on roads.
	Therefore, the effective provision of safety on highways should aim
	jointly at these three components. There has been a great evolution
	in the characteristics of two of these components; the vehicle and
	the driver. However, geometric design of roads has not been updated
	enough to be integrated with these two components. To date, geometric
	elements are designed based on assumptions and criteria studied and
	verified over 60 years ago. Therefore, the objective of this research
	is to relate driver behaviour to geometric characteristics of the
	highway and to safety. It is aimed at improving the current geometric
	guides to accommodate the driver behaviour in a quantitative manner.
	This is accomplished through focusing on the road user as a main
	element in highway design. To fulfill this objective, an experiment
	was designed to collect driver behaviour data using an instrumented
	test vehicle. Thirty volunteers were recruited to drive the vehicle
	on a route consisting of different functional classes of highways.
	The data collected from these instruments along with the geometric
	alignment of the highways traversed formed a large database, which
	was used to evaluate the interaction between driver behaviour and
	geometric characteristics of the road. The models developed were
	in turn used to develop updates to the current geometric design guides.
	These driver behaviour models were then used to relate driver behaviour
	to safety on roads. The importance of this research lies in its economic
	and social impacts. Economic impacts can be realized in terms of
	reduced property loss, large savings in terms of medical expenditure
	and insurance claims, and significant reduction in lost working days
	due to injury or loss of earning power due to death. The social benefits

	when trying to enter a T-junction working under the near-side priority
	rule; evaluation of the performance of the near-side priority rule
	both in terms of its ability to regulate light traffic conditions
	and in relation to safety. The work was done based on data collected
	at Portuguese junctions during the period March/May 1989. To describe
	drivers' approaching patterns to junctions a descriptive model was
	developed using multiple regression techniques. Linear relations
	between a number of explanatory variables and the variables describing
	the approaching movements (vehicles' speeds at different points and
	the inverse of travel times measured in selected sections of the
	roads) were obtained. The relative importance of the explanatory
	factors tended to change during the approach to the junctions with
	the initial motion conditions being the most important in the initial
	stages and the influence of the priority streams of traffic and of
	the decisions related to the priority utilisation process gaining
	importance nearer to the junction. Standard drivers' behaviour patterns
	were identified as was some characteristic behaviour variability
	which, it was considered, corresponded to different driving styles.
	To study the interactions between conflicting drivers wishing to
	enter a T-junction working under the near-side priority rule, a methodology
	based in gap acceptance concepts was developed. A concept of negative
	lag was introduced to represent situations in which a non-priority
	vehicle faces a stopped priority one when it arrives at the junction.
	An important aspect of the approach used is that it enables the description
	of each situation in accordance with the priority theory even when
	the rules are not respected. From the results obtained it could be
	concluded that, on one hand, a significant number of vehicles' interactions
	were wrongly solved from the priority rule point of view, while on
	the other hand the existence of intransitive situations did not prove
	a significant problem in fluidity terms. The `natural expectancies'
	(wrong feeling of superiority shown specially by straight-through
	vehicles using the side of the road nearer to the interrupting leg)
	and the `follow-out' (tendency to follow another vehicle into the
	junction if it is performing the same movement) phenomena have shown
	particular influence on the way drivers' interactions were solved.},

	have not been addressed. This study addresses the effects of HGVs
	as lead vehicles on drivers' car-following behaviour. This was done
	by utilizing 30 test subjects to drive the TRG's instrumented vehicle
	in the traffic stream, where it was found that drivers increase their
	time gaps while following HGVs compared to following vans and cars.
	Furthermore, the effects of HGVs on driver behaviour were found to
	increase on upgrade sections. As regards driver characteristics'
	effects on car-following, male drivers were observed to follow at
	smaller headways than female drivers. Moreover, older drivers followed
	at the largest headways while no differences in headways were observed
	between young and middle aged drivers. Young female drivers and middle
	aged drivers of both genders displayed the greatest stability in
	driver behaviour while old drivers of both genders and young male
	drivers displayed less stable behaviour. Additionally, no effect
	of trailing vehicle type on driver behaviour while following was
	observed in this study. This study confirmed two of the hypothesized
	sources of HGVs' effects on driver behaviour, those being vision
	obscuration and psychological impacts. Another valuable contribution
	of this study was testing whether time headway is constant for an
	individual driver, where it was found that drivers do not maintain
	constant time gaps from one following process to another. Finally,
	a linear model was developed to enable prediction of time gaps.},

	of car-following models. Both the utility of a given lane and the
	risk associated with lane changes is determined in terms of longitudinal
	accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This allows
	for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria
	both for symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative
	elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of the
	longitudinal traffic models are automatically transferred to the

	not only the own advantage but also the (dis-)advantages of other
	drivers associated with a lane change via a politeness factor . The
	parameter allows to vary the motivation for lane-changing from purely
	egoistic to a more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature
	allows first to prevent change lanes for a marginal advantage if
	this obstructs other drivers, and, second, to let a pushy driver
	induce a lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to be no longer
	obstructed. In a more general context, we show that applying the
	MOBIL concept without politeness to simple car-following models and
	cellular automata results in lane changing models already known in
	the literature.},

  abstract = {The application of aerial survey methods to record and study the movement

	of traffic flow hysteresis. This phenomenon is manifested as a generally
	retarded behavior displayed by a platoon of vehicles after emerging
	from a kinematic disturbance as compared to the behavior of the same
	vehicles approaching the disturbance. Although data suitable for
	the study of the phenomenon is still quite scarce, the appearance
	of the retardataion effect has been confirmed for all ten platoons
	studied to date. This paper undertakes an analysis of the nature
	of the hysteresis phenomenon from both a macroscopic and a microscopic
	point of view. Macroscopically attention is concentrated on the relationships
	existing between speed and density, volume and density, kinetic energy
	and density and mean headway and density. Each relationship is shown
	to dispaly distinctly different characteristics for disturbance approaching

	is given to the acceleration-deceleration asymmetry which underlies
	the hysteresis phenomenon and the concepts of car following theory

	a proposed model aims to emulate less-than-perfect everyday driving
	while capturing both safe and unsafe driver behavior. Most important,
	a realistic perception-response process is incorporated into the
	model on the basis of developments from visual perception studies.
	Driver inattention is characterized by a driver-specific variable
	called the scanning interval. This variable, when coupled with the
	driver's visual perception-response process, results in variable
	reaction times that are dependent not only on each driver's individual
	characteristics but also on instantaneous traffic conditions such
	as speed and density. This allows closer emulation of real-life human
	driving and its interactions with surrounding vehicles. Both inter-
	and intradriver variations in reaction time are captured in a plausible
	and coherent manner; in earlier studies, reaction time either was
	presumed fixed or was of limited variability. Furthermore, parameters
	of this model have a direct physical and behavioral meaning; this
	implies that vehicle collisions, if any, can be analyzed for behavioral
	patterns rather than simply being treated as numerical artifacts.
	In all, 54 detailed and accurate vehicle trajectories extracted from
	10 real-life crashes were used to test the model's capability of
	replicating freeway rear-end collisions. High-resolution crash-free
	trajectory data were used to validate the model against normal driving
	behavior. Test results indicate that the proposed model is able to
	replicate both normal and unsafe driving behavior that could lead
	to vehicle collisions. The feasibility of integrating the proposed
	model with existing microsimulators is discussed. The outcome of
	this work could facilitate studying crash mechanisms at a high-definition
	microscopic level and could enable safety-related system design improvements
	and evaluation through microsimulation software.},

	the delay of the driver's response in sensing headway. The stability

	soliton solution and kink-antikink soliton solution for the KdV equation
	and mKdV equation respectively. The numerical results in the form
	of the space-time evolution of headway show that the stabilization
	effect is weakened when the driver's physical delay increases. It

	headway plays an important role in jamming transition, and the numerical

	approaching the European side of the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul,
	Turkey. The stretch behaves as a recurrent bottleneck in the afternoon
	peak. Flow data were extracted manually from video recordings taken
	from stations along the highway stretch and then converted into cumulative
	vehicle count curves constructed for each lane at the count stations.
	Radar detector data taken from a point within the horizontal curve
	were used to construct an occupancy-flow diagram. The empirical results
	show that drivers behave in some respects as outlined in the theory.
	For example, drivers in the median lane do not redistribute themselves
	across lanes although their speeds are below those in the shoulder
	lane, as opposed to the theory, but redistribution occurs later.
	This implies that more than speed differential across lanes affects
	driver behavior in the median lane. Flow differences and then equalization
	were observed in the median and shoulder lanes in free-flow and congested-flow
	states, respectively. There was a fast-moving queue in the median
	lane in a semicongested state while free-flow conditions in the shoulder
	lane were prevailing, in harmony with the theory. A relation between
	capacity drop due to bottleneck activation and bottleneck segment
